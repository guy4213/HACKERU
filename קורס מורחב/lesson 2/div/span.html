        Representing Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres in the 2001 CARIFTA Games, winning a silver medal.  <br/>The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.[28]</p>

                He made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals,<div>but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.[29] Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van </div>  when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. <br/> <br/>
 
                He was detained by the police for his practical joke, <span style=" font-size: 45px; color: blue;" >and there was an outcry from the local community </span> which blamed coach McNeil for the incident.[25] However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively.[28] <br/><br/>
         
                He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean 
                Junior Championships.[30]</p>
